1,DependentBonus768,April 2024,"r/ChatGPT AI has so much potential to improve healthcare - from helping doctors diagnose to enabling precision care for patients which couldn’t have been possible earlier. But AI can also go wrong if ethics aren't made a priority from the start.

Open for further discussion on the same!!"
2,NoAdvertising1842,March 2024, WITH USING AI ALGORISM TO STRTIFY ACCUMALATED MEDICAL  DATA IN PAST 50 YERAS TO DRIVE PRECSION IN DIAGNOSIS AND MACH WITH PATIENT CUURENT HISTORY ..SO  AI CAN ASSIGN BEST TREATEMENT PLAN THAN WHO EVER MD IS THERE..THIS MAY APPY TO ALL MEDICAL NON INTERVTINAL CASES AT LEAST  FOR NOW
3,Sweenybeans,March 2024,Ai is extremely limited at them moment. I think this will be a joke. IBM tried DR. Watson awhile ago and it failed. IBM has the most advanced AI algorithm btw

5,Hurndawg18,February 2024,I am doing a research project on the effect of AI in healthcare. I was wondering if y'all could take maybe 30 seconds to fill out a quick survey to gather research on everyone's opinion. [Effects of AI on healthcare link](https://forms.gle/dM7r9YNcWET9gtSTA) Thank you so much.
6,Eizonix,January 2024,"AI's potential in healthcare truly excites me as well—its capacity to transform care is vast. Recently, AI has made strides in personalized medicine, particularly in predicting patient outcomes and treatment responses. What's revolutionary is AI's role in analyzing large datasets to uncover patterns that might not be evident to human researchers. This is not only speeding up the drug discovery process but also helping in tailoring treatments to individual genetic profiles. Another area where AI shows promise is in improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing errors in image-based diagnoses like X-rays and MRIs. AI algorithms can now detect nuances that escape even seasoned radiologists, leading to earlier and more accurate diagnoses. I believe we're just scratching the surface of what AI can achieve in improving both the efficiency and the quality of healthcare."

9,wolffemmet,September 2023,"I personally think there are tons of ways AI could assist in healthcare across the board. Information input / output alone would be crazy, as well as the idea of simply having AI nurses.  
In elderly homes / care facilities it would be huge too.  Even just an AI system that was informed of their patient, their daily routine, their medicine (which is SO hard for elderly folks to remember), and so much more.  And used as a reminder / information friend/person to their patient :)

If applied and integrated well enough I think it could change the game."
10,theweekinai,September 2023,"AI is being used to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery. For example, AI is being used to develop new scheduling systems that can help hospitals and clinics to better manage their resources."
11,JohnnyAngel,September 2023,so honestly pairing each nurse to an ai woyuld be great instead of each nurse having a computer give each room the right sensons and it would really free them up to just focus on the person

15,Anen-o-me,September 2023,"For some time now we've had access to information in far greater quantity than a single human brain can integrate.

It used to be a single person could read everything in a single field--that ended centuries ago.

Today to be up to date even in your own specialist niche you would need to read in several languages and follow the science globally. And even then it's only what others consider the big ideas that come to most people's attention, even in that niche.

There are undoubtedly good ideas that don't reach the mainstream of a niche.

AI will bridge that gap, making the entire corpus of knowledge accessible to a single specialist.

You will still need to be a specialist to know how to parse and use that knowledge, with the AIs assistance.

But especially for genetic conditions, one mind will never grok all that info, but AI can. All those interactions, how genes code for 3d structures, etc."
16,Brilliant_Ad_1320,September 2023,yep! it's going to happen . Too many citations and amendments to academic papers . hundreds of thousands of academic papers . Healthcare is expensive and most people don't like what they have which makes it worthy to disrupt . AI is going to hit Healthcare hard .
17,Total-Opposite-960,September 2023,"Personally I’ve been using AI a lot to five chatgpt an information source, tell it relevant personal information about myself, and having it summarize the information from the source that is relevant to me. If precision medicine become a thing there’s going to be an abundance of personal information to be considered in healthcare that I think AI is going to be instrumental in sorting through and organizing in a way a provider can act on."

22,tooold4urcrap,September 2023,I trust AI and a doctor more than I trust a doctor with no use of AI.
23,superkp,September 2023,"Patients report symptoms. *doctors* make a decision on what those symptoms mean.

Endoscopes, X-rays and MRIs look inside people. *doctors* make a decision on what the resulting imagery means.

Endless catalogues of medical texts and studies will show doctors statistics and trends related to their patient. *doctors* make a decision on how the patient fits into those trends.

AI can certainly be used to *assist doctors* in finding good treatments for their patients, *but the doctor must be the one to make the decision.*

I see a lot of value in AI for medical stuff. Things like finding new molecules that could have otherwise-unused uses especially.

But the moment that we offload medical decisions, especially diagnoses, we are allowing doctor's to avoid the responsibility of doing what they need for their patients, and that way lies huge cans of worms that humanity has opened in the past, and it rarely works out for the good of the patient."
24,Anen-o-me,September 2023,"It's very promising. Every time you see a doctor they are various levels of stumped. And the more rare it is the more likely they won't catch it.

Which will hopefully lead to better prevention, quicker diagnosis better treatment plans based on facts and no bias."
35,Suspicious-Rich-2681,September 2023,"It's good, *until it's not.*

LLM take:

Remember LLM answers are not guaranteed to be correct even in the slightest. The algorithm at its core predicts natural language responses - and this offers some benefit when right, and much harm when wrong.

If we're talking implementation on the level of diagnostics, then it's a very obvious no. Don't get me wrong, there are many cases where a diagnostic pattern follows routine, and this would be what the system would be great for; leveraging common patterns to see and predict clinical outcomes. However, as any doctor would tell you - there are equally as many cases where healthcare is not so predictable and disease outcomes can only be predicted with a solid understanding of the subject material.

A good example would be the running gag we have on googling a headache and getting back ""you have cancer"". LLMs have more parameters than your typical google search, but scenarios like that can arise quite quickly. It is not a replacement for doctors.

Where I could see it being useful though, is in either being a tool to doctors and nurses, or being better at patient support or QA. Since LLMs are built on the knowledge that's been gathered through hundreds of years of medical knowledge, they're an easy way for a doctor to confirm steps or find out about missed issues. i.e. asking ""I'm trying to diagnose X and I'd like to know what else to screen for?"" means that a doctor has easy access to effectively the textbook material. It's not going to make a diagnostic, but it can help eliminate human shortcomings.

In terms of patient support and QA, lots of areas like being a buddy to talk to or comfort, or even helping to break down certain concepts is good. LLMs are good at being a comforting voice, because they're trained on comforting voices in data.

Other Prediction Algorithms:

These follow the same pathway as LLMs. They can be used as a diagnostic tool by doctors and nurses, but shouldn't be used to make the diagnostic themselves. They're tools. Nothing more."

39,Kwahn,September 2023,"I'm building out use-cases for AI in multiple ways at the large fertility group I'm a data director and principal architect for.

First, we're doing large-scale sentiment analysis on patient communications, bypassing the need for explicit surveys - if a patient's communications were frustrated and unhappy, that will leak through in the telehealth transcription, the SMS conversations and the emails and portal messages!

Second, we're structuring unstructured data en masse - old free text notes containing details about orders and results and surgical findings are becoming structured sets of data that we can query, like measurement qualities and descriptive findings.

Third, we're using it to pull in large PDF chart tomes, often sent by outside hospitals and other parties, to sift through and pull out the actually relevant information like lab and ultrasound measurements for doctors to more quickly read through.

Fourth, we're using it on the back-end financial side to spot anomalies and detect trends in increased and decreased patient resource utilization and billing issues - not exactly a new use, but exciting nonetheless!

Fifth, we're using it for research - we're hoping to find the exact amounts of stimulation medication that is optimal for every single individual patient, but coming up with an individualized plan is heuristically suboptimal... unless you're a computer which can crunch those numbers and expose that information quickly!

Sixth, many of our nurses and patient care coordinators have very high medical skills, but can come from backgrounds with weaker English communication capabilities - we are working on a system to have an artificial intelligence read through the patient's prior information and, based on their most recent submitted question, suggest a possible response for the clinic to use.  (This cannot submit the response to the patient autonomously, I don't trust AI to be accurate enough for that yet, so a human must review it and decide if they like it.)

Seventh, clinical decision support at all levels - from embryology, to initial diagnostics, to post-treatment post-mortem follow-up and follow-through procedures.

And, lastly, we're working on giving GPT access to all employees as a general way to improve overall functionality and capabilities.

Very, very, VERY exciting stuff - feel free to ask me for more details about any of my work!"

Absolutely terrified for humanity within private conversations. With the trends of the hospitals running doctors as they are disposable makes them not want to work as hard just to be replaced at the drop of a new process.

The aversion to adopt AI is strong because it causes job displacement for people who spend 7-14 years in education to get the privilege to do what they do. I would feel the same in their position.

129,C501212,March 2024,"You make a fair point about the potential for AI-powered medical devices and patient-driven adoption in healthcare. It's easy to envision a future where affordable, user-friendly gadgets connected to our smartphones can perform diagnostics like ultrasounds, endoscopies, and even tissue sampling. Coupled with AI analysis, these could theoretically enable self-diagnosis that rivals or exceeds the capabilities of overworked doctors at understaffed public hospitals.

However, we have to consider the human factor. Doctors themselves may resist this disruption out of fears over job security and having their expertise usurped by machines. But more crucially, entrusting one's health entirely to AI self-diagnosis raises concerns over safety, liability, and whether patients truly understand the complexities involved. Even if the technology is highly accurate, missing that experienced human perspective could be risky when it comes to therapy decisions and following through on treatment.

So while the affordability and convenience could drive adoption by patients frustrated with access to quality care, I suspect the reality will involve more of a partnership. Responsible physicians will likely leverage AI as a tool once the transparency and reliability is proven, not discarding human judgment entirely. The most effective approach going forward is probably an symbiotic relationship between the AI analytical capabilities and human medical expertise working in concert for optimal patient outcomes. Disruptive technology alone, no matter how empowering for patients, is no panacea without the human element."

131,Fast-Satisfaction482,March 2024,"I strongly believe that it will be also doctor driven. If you consider the German public health system, there is a table for how much a doctor can charge for different treatments. The doctors always complain that those tables don't cover the actual costs and they can only survive by preferring patients with private insurance where they are allowed to charge more for the same treatment. So I foresee a clear incentive for doctors to rely on AI as long as it is legal and cheaper than the staff it replaces. This is true for hospitals, specialists, general physicians. All have the same charging structure and thus the same incentive to operate at lower costs. And it might be glorious, because the capacity of those doctors will expand and the regular people who are not allowed to have private insurance will no longer have to wait months to see specialists."
132,Plane_Cantaloupe9556,March 2024,"Yes, this is interesting. Customer/patient demand is how other technologies, for example, the at-home pregnancy test, became common practice despite the resistance of doctors. I would like to see the power dynamic change in healthcare- you are the expert of your body.  

With a technology that can give you the evidence, science, advice, and care options around your problems, you have more opportunities to figure out how you can best care for your health. If the goal is a healthier population (and not healthcare making money as a business), then this kind of technology would be huge."
133,Shubb,March 2024,"This is why I think its going to be more and more important to start collecting data on your health, so that you have a robust dataset that an AI could analyze. Now some stuff you cannot do yourself ofc, but, I think products like smart scales and smart watches (who has health monitoring) will actually start to matter a lot in the outcome. Especially if our system can start to incorporate Personal screening for certain diseases. For instance if we notice that people who are over Y cm tall, weight under X kg, have a Z value of C, live in a city, have a huge increased risk of R, then all of these could get a propper medical screening. ie. Screening for disease could get much more efficient.

I also envision that any disease will be detected much quicker, and way before symptoms in many cases, And the more parameters you can messure, the better. 

Although there are huge risks aswell, for example hypocondria could get worse, and we could see an increase in health anxiety. And there could be ethical implications of who deserves to get screened, etc."
134,FosterKittenPurrs,March 2024,"The problem is whether it will be useful at this stage. Much like with the Apple Watch and reporting various heart issues, with many of them there isn't anything we can actually do with that info, like not even doctors. Giving heart meds for mild heart issues can do more harm than good overall. It can be dangerous to look with an at-home ultrasound, you see a mass and freak out, and then you get a risky biopsy that gives you an infection that goes septic, all to show the mass was benign and wouldn't have affected you in any way.

That is not even considering all the ways in which AI might go wrong. There was a recent post on Reddit about how an AI was given an MRI of a fish and it was giving credible diagnosis as if it were a human. It would tell people all kinda crap in a very authoritative way, people are gonna follow all kinds of stupid advice, and suddenly we're going to have AI companies having super strict restrictions for any medical uses, either because of lawsuits or regulations.

The best short-term AI adoption will happen in research labs. It already is being used there, and there are some amazing meds coming out of it. Also with helping doctors and nurses with all the bullshit paperwork, so they have more time to spend with patients etc."

I think at first doctors will resist out of distrust of the quality of the advice being provided. 


Patients will show up with far too much knowledge about their conditions, and I'm sure they'll have been provided ""bad advice"" which the doctors will use as proof.


But the critical flaw is the lack of available medical services. The shortage of doctors and nurses, the insane costs/bills and the overall bad experience will drive patients rapidly towards AI.


Also another huge crack in the armor for healthcare I think has to be preventative medicine.


I don't think there's any reason why all diseases cannot be treated in advance before symptoms arise with powerful enough technology.

It's natural selection. AI needs us, cause AI is not WISE. It is INTELLIGENT. See?

The masses of homo sapiens don't need intellect, however, the rulers must have greater intellect than the masses. In order to have this intellect, you must become one with AI.

190,DeletedUser,February 2023,"I am a data scientist working on healthcare AI. This is my area of specialization.

So here is my take: AI cannot be “better” than the best diagnosticians, since it is trained on human-made diagnoses.

What CAN it do? It can diagnose things FASTER. A computer is much faster than a human. So I envision AI being used for quickly do extremely repetitive, mundane tasks at a faster speed.

For example: you can use NLP to automate scribing, or use OCR to automatically read and fill out insurance paperwork."
191,Factotumm,February 2023,"I work with this stuff for my job.  I know it looks like magic at times.  Currently ChatGPT is starting to invade a whole lot of areas and it is undoubtedly useful for a lot of things however....

These models are purely linguistic in nature and are really no smarter than a parrot with a huge set of phrases.  They do not ""understand"" anything other than how words are most frequently combined in certain contexts.  

They have been trained on a huge corpus of existing literature and they use statistical models based on word and phrase occurrences to generate their responses.

Consequently, the responses are going to be what ""most people"" would do and they will never produce anything that has never been done before.  You are going to get the ""consensus"" of whatever literature it has been fed and even then, it may combine these things in totally inappropriate ways.

So that's what is under the hood and nobody who understands this stuff at a deep level would trust it with anything that might impact public or personal safety."

I truly believe in 10-15 years AI will be running the bulk of healthcare and cerebral specialties will see a decrease in demand. Hands on specialties like surgery will probably be safe for longer.

Most researchers in this field agree that AI techniques are very far from being remotely clinically applicable. The more experience with the details, the farther we think we are from clinical use.

Many things that we think are “AI” are just somewhat fancy data monitoring algorithms or rudimentary natural language processing. 

Part of the issue is “AI” is so tenuously defined that companies / research groups will tack it onto anything they make that uses something other than linear or logistic regression models. I think being precise with terminology is important lest the lay public take an idea and misconstrue it as something more advanced than reality."

My knowledge in medicine is quite limited, better at Automatic Control and AI.

I think the main issue is legal and uncertainty. AI works 99% of the time since it's mainly built on statistical models, statistical models have uncertainty. How do you know what cases are in the 1% that makes it fail? How do you know it's 1% of the cases? Who is responsible if the AI fails? How do you make sure people don't trust the AI as if it's correct in 100% of the cases?"

205,harlow2088,October 2022,"Contracted for AI in diagnostic imaging when I was younger. I can’t speak for other fields, but in our field, there are claims that it’s much more accurate than the technologists scanning and I feel like it’s a scary road we are headed down that will be filled with lawsuits. Of course the AI is going to be considered “more accurate”, because it’s a combination of mapped out measuring from the same 5 technologists vs the 100 you’re testing against. Obviously there will be more error in the 100 group, but who is to say the other techs are wrong? I feel if we visited AI to capture the images for the technologists to measure (and save the toll the field takes on their bodies), we’d be onto something, but things like AI for vascular waveforms or an EF in echo, have been found to be pretty inconsistent/inaccurate in live mode (published studies usually pull patients with nice pictures - not every day difficult scans). There’s also a saying that there is a difference between being a sonographer and a photographer - if you get techs into AI mode, they are much more likely to miss pathology. I’m sure we can do great things with it at some point, but I think there’s such pressure to get the product out there, these AI companies are missing the bigger picture and too busy competing against one another."

208,aedes,October 2022,"There are some fundamental issues that need to be resolved before AI use in medicine becomes common place:

1. Dealing with noise. And I only partly
mean noise in the way Kahneman means. Medicine is noisy. There is a large degree of uncertainty in input values. Even with the most objective data we deal with, significance remains a function of patient-specific factors (ie pretest probability) which remain highly noisy and subjective. AI does not do well at all with this.   

2. AI is not really “intelligent” currently. This is most obvious when you present an AI with something weird that is outside of its training set. It will either fail completely or do something completely bizarre. This is because it doesn’t actually “understand” the concept behind what it’s doing. The severity of the inappropriate response to these edge cases means you need human oversight, limiting the utility of the AI.  

3. Related to item two, much AI research does not use appropriate measures of accuracy. Classification will be reported as a dichotomous variable, where all misclassifications end up being weighed the same, regardless of the severity of misclassification. This has the effect of making AIs look more accurate and useful on paper than they are in real life.  

4. Developing and implementing an AI is expensive in many ways. It represents a significant infrastructure investment. It also represents change. Due to the complexity of the medical environment, any change ends up being complicated, expensive, and potentially harmful to patients during the transition. As a result, in order to justify any change, what you are changing to needs to be significantly better than what we currently use. This is why fax machines remain so wide-spread in medicine. Even if we had a good AI right now, it would need to offer significant improvements over what we currently due to justify the issues with change, and implementation would take many years before it was wide spread. 

5. Responsibility and legal issues remain unsatisfactorily resolved. Even if we had a good AI right now, what happens when it makes a mistake? It titrates the norepi wrong and the patient loses their limbs. Who’s at fault? The hospital that purchased this AI? The creator of the AI? The healthcare team that was using it? I don’t think people take this risk quite seriously enough yet, and probably won’t until a few lawsuits come up in the future. The moment this happens though, this represents another barrier to implementation. If I have to take responsibility for the outcomes of this black box making decisions... why would I choose to use it at all? Since it remains a black box, I can’t trust it, and need to verify everything it does, at least outside of certain situations, which obviates its utility in the first place."

243,thumbsquare,October 2022,"Just one example: 

I saw Emery Brown from MGH give a talk a few years ago, where he said he was studying/trialing using EEG+AI to assist in dosing anesthetic only to the point that the pt’s EEG demonstrates a signature of proper anesthesia. He demonstrated that there’s significant divergence between how much anesthetic his tool recommends, vs standard dosing practices. He also studied this technique in elderly folks, who he said are more susceptible to cognitive deficits following GA. His results showed that limiting dose using his technique in elderly patients significantly limited the cognitive impact of GA. 

I’m a neuroscientist who uses various machine learning techniques as a tools—to me the EEG signature of anesthesia (at least that you see in papers and seminars) seems so obvious and robust that it should be a fairly safe application for AI in medicine, and this technique augments the anesthesiologist rather than replacing them entirely, which seems like an important attribute for managing the device-maker’s liability."

245,Lon_ami,October 2022,"AI has some awesome potential in my field (EM)   

Take medical records review.  It's not uncommon for me to see a patient just discharged from the hospital after a stay of a couple weeks.  I need to find out what actually happened during the stay.  But when I open up the EMR the DC summary is a copy and paste of the admission note, which was itself mostly templated and god knows why stock phrases (""I thoroughly washed my hands and donned a gown before examining the patient"") and more copypasta.  An AI that could actually give me the useful information from the patient's past history would be great.  

Then there's EMR pop-up spam.  Yes I know quality control and compliance love to throw in a million pop-ups every time I make a diagnosis of dizziness or headache (what's the stroke score?) or the patient's heart rate goes above 90 and triggers the sepsis pathway or the patient in the ED for insomnia also has a POLST that needs documented review, or maybe the patient being coded for asystolic arrest also needs an annual flu vaccine.  An AI that could automatically close or fill out these popups would be lovely.  

My other pet peeve is alarms.  Basically everyone in my ED is on some kind of monitor and at any given time half of them are beeping about something.  I have a pretty good sense of who is sick in the department so I usually ignore the alarms but the noise gets to me after a few hours.  I don't need to be constantly reminded that my patient on an energy drink binge has a heart rate of 120.  That's why they're in the department, it won't change anytime soon.

I imagine, however, it will largely be confined to diagnostics and potentially to treatment *guidance* of human providers, rather than realtime machine-directed diagnosis and treatment. My mentor said something recently that illustrates a big fundamental challenge:

“When something goes wrong, it was probably human error. But for something to go *really* wrong? That takes a computer.”

The problem, far as I can tell, is you can train machines to do things with astonishing accuracy and fidelity, but just slightly alter the scenarios from the training—as is characteristic of medical care—and machines get things wildly, bizarrely wrong.

So 99.9% of the time or so, everything is hunky-dory, but then there are black swan events, ranging from the amusing—Watson’s “What is ‘leg’?”; Boston Dynamics’ creatures strange stuttering gyrations—to the horrifying: self-driving cars plowing into people; Boeing 737 MAX planes power-diving passengers into oblivion.

A lot of my own work seems to be cleaning up systematic errors made by computer algorithms, errors so obviously wrong a human would never make them, but totally within the flawed-in-hindsight logic that trained the computer. I would be horrified by anyone planning to trust a machine algorithm with live patient care in the absence of very rigorous testing and close human oversight.

Can you imagine if the kind of feedback loop that led to the horrors of the 737 MAX ended up in a Levophed pump?

This will be the reality of AI in medicine. It has great potential, but there is no doubt AI will only hinder physicians and nurses."
256,EphemeralConvergence,October 2022,"There’s a new AI program rolling out to primary care that learns with you to essentially act as a virtual medical scribe. You turn the mic on and do your office visit speaking casually/normally to your patient (except you do have to say out loud your exam) and at the end you get a fully fleshed out note. Apparently it can take a few hours at first but once it learns your style it can be sent to you within minutes. 
These are the types of advancement I think are really beneficial - things that cut non value added tasks and let’s us just be more clinical and efficient."
257,hartmd,October 2022,"I have worked on a handful of projects to solve various tasks using AI and am actively participating in several right now.

Definitely a useful tool in some instances but doubtful it will be replacing any clinicians any time soon.

Just implementing the infrastructure to allow an ML process to learn from available data requires a lot of  input from clinicians, a surprising amount of standard rules based support and then monitoring to supervise how well or not well it is doing over time.

Once you get it all set up and running, it almost always requires supervision.  While the task it will be doing will presumably be useful, it is almost always a relatively small piece of much larger process which proves to be a substantial limiting factor when trying to fully automate. 

Finally, implementing incremental improvements after creating a functional product I have found is often more challenging than doing the same with a standard logic based system.   

I think we will start seeing much better clinical decision support systems in the next 5 to 10 years with AI being a big reason for this (but not the only).  Alert warnings will be much more accurate than what doctors see today if/when implemented.  I see it increasingly augmenting our decision making processes in a useful manner, helping to predict or suggest diagnosis and treatments.  I doubt any clinicians will be replaced by it in the next 10 to 20 years, though.


Edit

Another thought.  A big problem with some AI is just figuring out how to query it to get useful answers.   For instance, you can sometimes get crazy good responses to clinical questions from GPT-3.   A significant challenge is figuring out how to provide input and ask it a question in such a way that the answer it provides is consistent with what you want.   It is often capable of providing surprisingly good answers.   But if you don't word and format your question right, it will be less than useful."
258,StewpidEwe,October 2022,"I don’t think these things will ever be fully automated. Even if the best embedded software engineering team nailed the software, there’s still always room for malfunction or failure. A firmware update could wreck the entire code. You’ll always need a human there to monitor and intervene. There’s a docudrama show called Mayday Air Disasters and looks at why plane crashes happened. It’s super fascinating, but there are numerous occasions where the autopilot technology or something it relies with failed and suddenly the plane goes into an uncontrollable barrel roll. I think the same thing applies with medicine. Even more so for surgery and anesthesia. 

The coolest stuff for me right now are the new tests coming out that can use genetics to show predisposition to diseases and have them treated or mitigated before they develop. It completely bipasses years of lab tests that may take a long time to show presence of disease."

267,Electrical_Tennis_88,May 2023,"I think this how it should play out.  I'm a radiologist and I see how the entire hospital and outpatient works up complaints.  Most of medicine is simple algorithms.  And in certain people's hands it's ridiculous how much stuff is ordered because of the algorithms and lack of clinical acumen. Especially certain ER positions and PAs who use imaging and labs to cover themselves and exclude the big stuff especially when they have a lack of knowledge of what's going on. CT chest abdomen pelvises for no reason. CT heads for no reason. 75% of the stuff we read is pointless and people just going through the algorithm for shortness of breath or chest pain or altered mental status.  Getting certain tests always get ordered just to rule out stuff.  And the difference between providers is a lot. One ER doc or PA may order more than double another one because they just order the same set of stuff on everyone.  AI should definitely be double checking these guys and flagging over utilizers.  However the hospitals have no incentive for that because they actually make more money when these guys order stuff. In the end what should actually happen is that all those docs get replaced by ai.  Pretty sure AI could manage diabetes, colds, hypertension and hyperthyroidism. Titer drugs.  The only thing missing is the human component. But some AI can actually fake that. But why not just use nurses or other providers who have enough knowledge to explain things, probably provide better empathy or more time, and will cost a lot less.  That AI nurse combo, will be way cheaper for the system and probably do a better job. No more pointless tests just to cover your butt. Or maybe that still exists but AI can do that if you want that kind of system.  That kind of program would actually be easier to create.  Why pay doc's 400 grand to do that?  Use AI and pay a nurse 80k to provide you that magical human component.

You seemed to suggest that those with less training (I'm guessing you mean mid-levels), could partner with AI and replace doctors.

I argue the opposite. AI is a great use case for getting rid of mid-levels. The less complex cases that NPs/PAs currently do could possibly be done by the AI with a physician signing off, especially if/when AI gets better than the NPs/PAs at these cases. This would leave only the more complex cases for physicians to soak up liability. These physicians could carefully collaborate with an AI, not use AI at all, or only use the AI to check if they may have missed anything."

282,Clinoid,March 2023,"""AI"" in its current form (or foreseeable forms) has absolutely no role in the diagnosis or management of any disease in medicine. There is a huge amount of incredibly biased literature with supposedly promising implementations, but this is really just a fancy veneer on the age-old issue with poorly specified and unvalidated prediction models. There are almost no examples where ""AI"" classifiers have been shown to outperform more conventional models.

The reason I put AI in inverted commas, is because really AI is just a black box classification algorithm. They are subject to pretty much all of the same limitations of conventional models, and unfortunately the literature is absolutely inundated with poorly designed and extremely biased ""machine learning"" studies. At its core, an ""AI"" model is really no different to using the CHADS-VASc, QRISK, etc. and for every CHADS-VASc, there are 100s of badly derived and unvalidated prediction models no one ever uses. Their conclusions range from useless to utterly dangerous. This is particularly the case for the latest trend of ""big data"" or ""real world data"", which is essentially a euphemism for inaccuracy.

It is conceptually interesting, but I am yet to see a convincing example of a model that might even prove non-inferior to human care in a randomised setting, let alone superior. Those who think an AI learning to write computer code is comparable to learning to treat patients simply have absolutely no idea how it works.

If I was a radiologist, for example, I would sleep soundly and not be even slightly worried about being replaced by ""AI""."
283,Duffyfades,March 2023,I just want AI that can at the very least pre-sort urine microscopic images.
284,StrongMedicine,March 2023," I think you are overemphasizing the importance of ""doubling time"" here. This isn't like Moore's Law with transistors and microchips. IMHO, a closer analogy is megapixels on pocket digital cameras from 20-30 years ago: at first, the increasing absolute number of megapixels was a big part of improved performance of cameras, but at a certain point, the pixels are no longer a limiting factor (compared to things like physical limitations of small lenses). At some point, compute is no longer the limiting factor for AI-driven tasks, but rather things like the structure of the code itself and human implementation. If compute doubling time was the most relevant parameter, and remains at 3.4 months, AI in 10 years would be 34 billion times (2^(10x12/3.4)) more ""powerful"" than today, and we'd probably be looking at the technological singularity. 


AI is likely already being integrated into your EHR. Its built into ours - front-end users just don't see it. (As one example: https://www.nuance.com/healthcare/ehr-partnerships/epic.html)


I've posted this here before, but remember Amara's Law ( https://miro.medium.com/max/768/1*hfYAMw7I3qc1ThspRvVq3g.png ): People overestimate the role of a new technology in the short-term, and underestimate it in the long-term. The day-to-day work of a typical physician will look very similar in 10 years as compared to today, but AI will render it completely different in 50-100 years.


In short, within the career span of anyone on this sub, we do not need to worry about AI replacing physicians, but rather AI-savvy physicians replacing AI-naive physicians."

291,Centrist_gun_nut,March 2023,"Hey! You're referencing,  I think, [https://openai.com/research/ai-and-compute](https://openai.com/research/ai-and-compute) , which summarizes the training compute time used to train models as ""doubling"" every 3.4 Months since it hit an inflection point in 2012. 

I don't know that we can expect this to continue. As the paper lays out, this is driven currently by (probably) two main factors: specialized hardware (TPUs) and willingness to throw money at the problem. IMHO that's really just one factor, money, since TPUs are built because of cost/spend. It's really hard to predict if that willingness to throw money in will continue unless some of the applications pan out, and soon. We're already seeing some startups in this space run out of runway. 

If Bing search and such don't translate into revenue, I would not expect this rate to continue.

I don't think know that this is necessarily an accurate metric for usefulness, either.

Also, lawmakers always want someone responsible to sue, so while I can foresee heavily AI assisted doctors, I don't see said AI replacing us, especially if a mistake is made and a life is lost. Suing Google is going to be much harder than suing your ER doc for those with average means.

Finally, public sentiment will play a large role. A large majority soured on public cars  (latest polls suggest about 3/4 don't trust them anymore compared to 1/2 a decade ago). I don't think the public will trust an autodoc either.

I research AI/ML use in secondary care as part of my role and I can tell you with 100% certainty that there is a huge need for a lot of these applications. We're already introducing 'intelligent' support systems and that is going to accelerate over the next decade.

NONE of these systems are there to take decisions AWAY from clinicians. They are there to help clinicians get to the right decision faster. Just as a century ago Rontgen was an alien for even considering the fact that you could see 'through' a body to identify bone breaks and other things, modern ML applications (very few if any will be what the audience considers AI/Generalist AI) are received sceptically until they demonstrate their value, the ones in operation are already that. 

In a healthcare system that is perennially short on time, the gift of time is the most valuable you can give a clinician and their patients. 

So to summarise, the author of this article, despite it being an MIT publication, is either very ill informed about developments in ML in healthcare, or deliberately wrote it in a way that would generate discussion. Reading the conclusion, it seems to be the latter. 

The big threat isn't within healthcare, it is with the general population that, instead of Googling their symptoms, will start asking unreliable LLMs instead."

373,mileylols,May 2018,"the current hot thing (or at least it was hot a year ago) are SMART (Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies) apps built on the FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) engineering standard. Basically FHIR is integrated into the EHR and provides an API for accessing the data inside, which provides significant advantages over the old ETL methods people had to use to get the data, which made it difficult to both train your own models and also to use models someone else developed on a different system. People were really excited at the idea that basically you could solve any problem if your healthcare network had the data available, kind of ignoring that if your network didn't have a robust IT infrastructure this wasn't going to solve any of your existing problems by itself. 

Anyway, to answer your question, I know of production models deployed in: 

 - identifying high readmission risk patients
 - early sepsis prediction
 - early diagnosis of colorectal tumors 
 - automated prescreening of radiology scans
 - optimizing patient transfers between departments 

These are just a few examples, but there's a lot of stuff going on, and it's all happening very fast, especially given how long it takes for healthcare systems to adopt anything. I think the major driver in this space is actually insurance. If you can demonstrate that a ML model can save providers money either through reducing current costs or improving outcomes (thereby reducing future costs), insurance will push their networks to use it, and it's going to get adopted."

It used conventional neural networks and very specific features measured from the suspicious lesions.

379,Techyfesto,July 2023,"Advantage of AI in Healthcare:  
AI in healthcare offers improved medical diagnosis and treatment. By analyzing vast amounts of clinical data quickly and accurately, AI algorithms can assist medical professionals in identifying crucial disease markers and trends that might otherwise be overlooked. This leads to more precise and personalized treatment plans, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and providing better quality care.  
  
Disadvantage of AI in Healthcare:  
One of the main disadvantages of AI in healthcare is the potential for ethical and privacy concerns. As AI systems handle sensitive patient data, there is a risk of data breaches and misuse of personal health information. Ensuring the security and privacy of patient data becomes paramount to avoid compromising patient confidentiality and trust in the healthcare system. Additionally, there may be concerns regarding the lack of human oversight and decision-making in certain AI-driven processes, raising questions about accountability and responsibility in case of errors or biases in AI algorithms.

Pulmonary TB is not a complex disease to treat from a medical standpoint, the ability of a computer to tell you to do RIPE therapy does not simplify treatment.

2) ( and most importantly) When/if you can automate or mostly automate physicians, there will be so many other automated jobs that society as we know it will have so profoundly changed so it's not even worth stressing out.

Fair to say that this is a mainstream trend and tech companies are on top of it.

TLDR version of the article: AI can augment healthcare analytics and assist consultation in terms of diagnosis, and provide personalized medicine, patient monitoring, and drug development in terms of treatment. Healthcare analytics can be done by training the AI with a library of medical images so that it can help recognize signs of disease from CT scans, etc. This information can then be used during consulting for real-time analysis (read: you won't need to return a few weeks later just to have the lab results read to you anymore). LLM-based AI can also help handle a lot of the paperwork. AI can also analyze your health records to draft a bespoke treatment plan for you that takes your medical history, allergies, lifestyle etc into account. AI in wards can monitor patients' vital signs and activity to make sure they are safe without intruding on their privacy. And finally AI can help design and test new drugs faster than humans can.

Edit: I realized my TLDR ended up being almost as long as the article I cited lol. Just read the article if you're interested, they have infographics and stuff that probably can explain things better than I can."
419,CalTechie-55,January 2024,AI should certainly be better at Differential Diagnosis than a doctor's unassisted memory.
420,Reasonable_South8331,January 2024,"It’s really great for differentiating diagnoses. I did a neurological assessment on my dog in the waiting room of an emergency vet and figured it out what was wrong with him. I was really relieved when the veterinarian came in, did his exam and tests and came to the same conclusion. My buddy was gonna be ok and recover. It ended up being something I had never really heard of before too."
421,SecretAshamed2353,January 2024,"To have an effect it would need more computing power, not just AI"
422,justgetoffmylawn,January 2024,"I'm a huge proponent of areas where AI can make massive improvements in healthcare. But despite the amazing potential of AI, I think your utopian view is missing a lot of the dystopian forest we'll have to traverse to get there.

Imagine an AI algorithm spotting cancer before it even develops - leading to unnecessary surgeries for 'early treatment' that doesn't actually improve survival rates or QoL but raises profits for hospitals.

Imagine an AI algorithm that reads an MRI and reinforces an incorrect diagnosis pattern in radiology because of incomplete and walled datasets.

Imagine an AI algorithm that can predict your likelihood of early-onset Alzheimer's but cannot do anything to slow down or treat it. Imagine the fights over who has access to that information.

There is so much potential (and really already helpful areas with LLMs), but dealing with our limitations in medicine, the entrenched dogma and bad data in healthcare, the profit motive keeping datasets as walled gardens and refusing to share strategies, and just general resistance from the establishment - it's going to be a wild ride, but a bumpy one.

We need to work on the underlying systems. AI, like humans, is subject to GIGO rules."
423,yestricia,January 2024,AI will not free up any time for anyone who is an employee. The efficiency invites more productivity.
424,RHX_Thain,January 2024,"AI will read through your online communications and photos looking for recognizable patterns, and warn you about potential health risks. Talking to the AI Doc will alleviate massive burdens through obvious diagnosis that GPs would never recognize because people are too afraid of the cost of Healthcare.



This however will be too useful and free, so immediately scammers will begin trying to fake it, and your insurance will begin doing it to build a profile about you, using it to increase rates. The medical lobby will push hard to eliminate any form of public access to this tool, ""for safety reasons, preventing illicit actors from having your data and preventing misdiagnosis,"" at which point they'll charge an exorbitant monthly fee for a worse service."
425,BusinessFish99,January 2024,"With all the things I see AI accomplish, I'll be impressed if A.I. can be taught to read doctors handwriting. 😂"
426,bubbazarbackula,January 2024,"I hope you are correct.  I, too, want that amazing health care AI seems to promise.  


But considering how the current GPT models are proving to have an impossible time being accurate, I am worried about AI in healthcare.  GPT has no problem delivering you a false answer, and then apogolizing and giving you another false answer...only to maybe give you the correct answer or another false answer.  


Additionally, any GPT subscribers can easily find extreme bias built into the AI.  You will get chastised for asking certain political or societal questions or statistical information.  Some questions it simply refuses to answer, though you can get a google response immediately.  More recently, GPTs have been updated to block responses to certain keywords, names or persona.  So there is overwhelming evidence of censorship and bias.  


So how will HealthAI respond to an obese patient, a smoker, somebody who has 8 alcoholic drinks a week, a diabetic who isn't following dietary advice, a cardiovascular patient not exercising, somebody who isn't following previous advice perfectly, etc?  Now you are in direct bias conflict with your AI.  


So no - I'll take a pass on healthcare AI for the moment."

437,BonFemmes,July 2023,"The price (amount we pay) of healthcare in the US has nothing to do with the cost of providing it.  It is driven by how much people will pay for it.

438,BasicallyFake,July 2023,its naive simply because healthcare costs are not driven by the actual costs of healthcare in the US
439,DeletedUser,July 2023,"What about if we think of it indirectly instead of “HAL 9000 checked me in” we think about use of AI to analyze a person’s health records/data against an entire database to make a determination such as “SilentThunder has a 86% genetic disposition to have a rare and hard to treat form of cancer/heart disease.” From this you could have the person checked for that disease or potential cancer earlier and more often.

My wife needed an immunotherapy for her breast cancer that cost $36,500 per infusion. They didn’t even know if it necessarily helped but it was being tried. I imagine instances like that where AI modeling and predictions could weed down the characteristics and decide if we really need to spend that $500,000 (cost of all treatments of just that one drug) on every woman with that form of breast cancer without knowing that the immunotherapy is even helping (and may be hurting)."

511,Sweet_Matter2219,July 2023,"This is a question of *economic impact*, so who you really want to be talking to is economics PhDs 
as they are certainly the most qualified. But I can begin tackling your Q.

Sure, there’s technically a chance it will nearly single handedly reduce prices, but that’s not saying much since there is a *chance* of many things happening in the universe that never do and never will happen.

There are A LOT of moving pieces that influence the prices of goods and services. Many industry Internal and industry external variables are involved from changing regulatory environments, individual and group level behavior, gambling markets, the cost of a dozen eggs in Tokyo on 9/11/2001, to which specific bush my dog chooses to pee in tomorrow. Thus, your question probably should be thought of in a different way. 

If we were to set aside the near infinite list of other variables to isolate the impact on pricing from the types of AI deployments your envisioning, without too much thought I can intuitively say that generally speaking some uses of AI will *partially contribute* towards decreasing costs / reduced pricing and conversely some uses of it will actually likely *partially contribute* towards increased costs, demand, and subsequent pricing. There’s a lot of ways this can happen in both directions.

In that lens, these opposite forces (some pushing towards higher prices and other towards lower) will likely “balance” or cancel one another out in some sense and as a result there won’t be much of a change overall from whatever the current direction of the status quo is. Relatively speaking that is and when accounting for inflation etc.

With all that said, of course my comments come with a lot of footnotes, caveats, and exceptions."

Unlike other industries, the cost savings AI would provide in health care comes out of the pockets of decision makers.

520,bit_shuffle,July 2023,"""AI"" is a broad term covering a lot of different computational techniques.

There is already a lot of research going into the use of AI for medical imaging analysis.  Early detection of tumors in MRIs is one of the big pushes.

What isn't talked about as much is simply getting a person's medical history (all the documentation of a person's diagnoses and treatments throughout their life) aggregated together and into the hands of their current physician.  ""EMR"" electronic medical records, are not really standardized like light bulbs or capacitors.  If you move from one provider to another, because of geography or change of employment, whatever, getting all your data transferred means talking to every provider you've had.  Then your current physician has to sift through your history to get a sense of what's happened and where you're at now.  AI might be able to summarize that, and highlight important factors using judgement ""learned"" from training by human doctors.  The use of expert systems is not new for medicine, but the use of NLP AI tools may allow deeper training of such expert systems than simple manual programming.

Most medical science is based on statistics.  The larger the sample set you can gather, the better you can confirm or eliminate possibilities, and certainly AI systems may be able to assist in that, however the main barrier is probably not really processing, at the moment.  The barrier nowadays is probably still ""N"".  Getting enough data points in a controlled way.

To really leverage AI in medicine, ""unsupervised learning"" techniques need to by employed.  And this could be done by allowing AI to ""observe"" patient charts and physician notes in patient files to associate measurements and symptoms with treatments and outcomes to ""learn"" what ""works"" and what ""doesn't work.""  But this would be a long (decades) and labor-intensive (both in the software development and medical data collection) process.

What is most likely to happen is a variety of different, specialized AI software platforms will emerge for doing relatively focused diagnosis tasks, centered around different types of sensors.  Ultrasound, MRI, respiration and blood pressure sensor data are almost certainly all being analyzed using the latest ML techniques.  The next steps will be ""fusing"" these data sources to establish ""features"" for recognition by ML systems, perhaps with predictive value."
521,TryptaMagiciaN,July 2023,"Simple answer: Will billionaires decide to not be greedy anymore? No. So no.

Long answer: who knows? Maybe we general strike within a yr or so and have economic reform and cut out much of the greed. Then maybe. The only thing that creates the majority of expense is running the system for profits when it should always be a cost sink by design. Funding should come from the public, we do not need to force medical researchers to come up with profit incentives to make care better. Decreasing quality of care has actually shown the opposite to be true. Profit motivated healthcare has worse outcomes when compared. Period

So who wants a general strike? We have to step up for healthcare workers because they obviously need to care for our ill and cannot afford to easily strike without doing harm. It is up to folks at UPS and those who are inspired by them."

You tell them what's wrong - they do tests and relay the info.  If an AI could simply recommend lab work, then tell you what the results were - you don't need a fuckin Doctor.

Costs are going to decline while accuracy, waiting times, and patient care increase rapidly. Doctors and nurses are going to see AI assisted treatments and robots with AI will begin performing surgeries that take minutes and are more precise than ever, resulting in less healing time and less complications.

The cost of that in India after conversion is $1.5. I ran out of it here and I couldn’t buy it OTC. Got a prescription and guess the cost. It was $320. And you know what the funny thing was? It was the same tube that I bought in India imported here. Even if you consider the import cost, markup etc., 213 times increase is atrocious and has only to do with policies and the system.

551,moonsion,July 2023,"I cannot say from an admin/insurance/policy perspective regarding the effects of AI in healthcare. But as a provider myself I can assure you America practices defensive medicine pretty much all the time, and that drives up cost. A majority of the imaging ordered by me/my peers/other doctors are not really necessary. A good clinical exam and history taking can make accurate diagnoses. There are plenty of papers supporting this. But despite this, I still order x-rays/MRI/labs all the time. Why? Because we live in a litigious society. There is always fear that if you don't do enough and patients were to have complications later, then you will be faced with malpractice. Same goes with antibiotics. Literature is very against overprescribing them, but heck we do it anyway. 

I do yearly medical mission trips abroad and I am always able to practice to my full scope and help a lot more patients that way. It feels awesome, and I am probably practicing more evidence based medicine abroad than over here."
552,minkestcar,July 2023,"I've spent the last 12 years professionally working to bring AI into healthcare, the last 8 at health tech startups. I have implemented AI at multiple ""integrated delivery networks"" (i.e. Groups with hospitals and clinics) in production.

Shortest answer: no. Short answer: it's complicated.

Brief answer:
In any of the clinical decision making processes errors can result in death, dismemberment, and/or malpractice. Those are all liabilities the healthcare industry and workers are very motivated to avoid because literally the goal is to do the opposite.  I've seen excellent models rejected because of perceived inaccuracy. Basically, if anybody sees any inaccuracy in the first 3 months of trial it won't get adopted.

In key billing processes the cost of errors is high: doing certain steps wrong counts as fraud, waste, and abuse _even if there was no fraud or ill intent_. That's a felony that comes with up to $250k fines and up to 5 years in jail per line item. That liability can be transferred to the individual workers doing those steps if they don't follow policy.  For a software vendor to use AI in those steps the AI company potentially becomes liable- and healthcare orgs will try to structure their contract indemnification clauses to make sure that's true.

In the rest of the process there are opportunities, but packaging the AI product and marketing in a way that gets industry adoption is quite tricky. Both my last companies failed to do that, despite having phenomenal tech. I've seen a few dozen others fail, and maybe only one or two succeed.

AI will decrease some costs, but probably not enough to meaningfully deflate prices because the expensive things are entrenched by legal liability and the economics mandated by the current regulatory environment. For AI to decrease costs in a meaningful way we'd need to see significant liability reform, breaking up of the large healthcare institutions, insurance reform, and possibly a reshaping of the pharma industry.  The costs are a symptom of the incentives we've provided and the dismantling of the cultural that motivated those perverse incentives, and AI will help us a lot once we figure that out.  It won't be soon."

Watch for the establishment blocking wave two."
556,scryharder,July 2023,"Never. That's the problem with profit motives - why EVER drop prices when you can just add savings and keep going?

Also you should look into how health insurance ACTUALLY works. They take your premiums then gamble on the stockmarket and hope to make more money.

Medicine is already an extortion cartel in the US and I don't see that stopping because Doctors are using AI, unless consumers can go around the medical industry for medical services. 

If firefighters got to negociate their prices while your kids were in a burning house, they'd charge you a million dollars to save them, no matter how little it cost the fire fighting company to do the work. That's what's going on with Medicine in the US. They will charge what the market will bear and the market will bear any cost to not die."

With AI though, anything more than say, a year out has so many likely and potential variables of different shapes and sizes that any projection is going to have massive caveats and potential ranges.

Having said that, there are some things that we can reliably infer - feel free to add to this list of what is effectively known-known's.  
\* AI accelerates advances and has significant potential to make breakthrough discoveries.  
\* AI has the potential to reduce the cognitive load on medical students and professionals, as well as people in similarly demanding fields.  
\* The condition that you're afflicted with is surprisingly common while also having a significant affect on well being. Importantly, it affects all strata of society, so it is the kind of thing that the rich and powerful will insist gets attention.  
\* Regrowth of various kinds of flesh is tied to longevity, which again, anyone who isn't a literal vampire probably feels incentivised to prioritise.

Known-unknowns encompass things like the chance during a given timeframe of breakthroughs. We can very, very roughly extrapolate a rate of scientific breakthroughs as a kind of base rate and then sprinkle on a little hope.  
That kind of work is quite time consuming though, so I don't think you'll see an answer in a forum comment.  
There are also little details like the effect on economies that mass automation are likely to have... there may be even worse things to worry about than medical conditions or situations that make medical conditions much more difficult to address than they would be in a world that was just ticking along as usual.  
On the flip side, there's always the chance that people of wealth and power listen to the Grinch and usher in a new age of unprecedented, shared prosperity.

Unknown-unknowns are largely whatever course AI takes on its way to... whatever comes next. Presumably AGI and then on to ASI, but nobody really knows.

Identify treatment options that happend „accidentally“ for example patients who were prescribed a drug for desease A but it also affected desease B positivel

So, an 8 month course of treatment can cost 200k if persistent coverage for the same problem averaged out higher over the life of a patient.  At least in the US, it’s just a dance around overall value with insurance companies and Medicare.

Development costs won’t get significantly cheaper because of AI, since AI derived ideas will still need to go through the same process to reach the market.

Advantage of AI in Healthcare: AI in healthcare offers improved medical diagnosis and treatment. By analyzing vast amounts of clinical data quickly and accurately, AI algorithms can assist medical professionals in identifying crucial disease markers and trends that might otherwise be overlooked. This leads to more precise and personalized treatment plans, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and providing better quality care.

Disadvantage of AI in Healthcare: One of the main disadvantages of AI in healthcare is the potential for ethical and privacy concerns. As AI systems handle sensitive patient data, there is a risk of data breaches and misuse of personal health information. Ensuring the security and privacy of patient data becomes paramount to avoid compromising patient confidentiality and trust in the healthcare system. Additionally, there may be concerns regarding the lack of human oversight and decision-making in certain AI-driven processes, raising questions about accountability and responsibility in case of errors or biases in AI algorithms.

590,bonkerfield,December 2021,"I worked in healthcare AI for 5 years. In the US, everyone is talking a big game, but the truth is the healthcare system has incentivized data collection entirely around billing with almost no value placed on health. Records for individuals are fragmented across so many different systems, EHR is difficult to parse and anything clean is something they had to write down for insurance. 

I was at a health insurance company for 2 years, and there it got even worse. I was in a meeting while the businesspeople were brainstorming an algorithm to help convince doctors when to give up on treatment and move on to hospice, just so they could save money.

Any AI added to the US healthcare system is just going to be optimizing how to extract money from the system even at the cost of human life.  And the funny thing is that most health issues are literally so easy to fix if we lowered barriers to access, gave people agency over their health, fixed our awful food system, and stopped exploiting everyone financially so they wouldn't need to turn to medication to cope."

It could be interesting. There are certainly unconscious biases that affect medical decision making by doctors (doctors are well aware of what they are, that does not mean they are immune from them). So I could see that AI might break through those biases, might even suggest the possible low-probability zebras, and presumably a doctor would take steps to confirm something AI suggested. 

It's already being used. My son had an MRI where the radiologist report noted having used an AI tool in the process of analyzing the image; the AI indicated an extremely abnormally small area in one part of the brain (patient has a chronic disease that does affect brain tissue and already has areas of essentially dead tissue, so radiology is very important in his case).

And to be honest, I think even those options are probably iffy.

I think if AI advances to the point where it can replace a bedside physician, even a non procedural one, then the vast majority of white collar jobs will be automated or in the process of moving that way and society will have bigger problems than unemployed doctors.

635,DeletedUser,February 2023,Ive just asked openai. It says we're fine
636,Vronicasawyerredsded,February 2023,"No. And here is why:

AI, though highly attuned, CANNOT replace the intuition and subconsciously sensations human beings have in relationships to one another when we communicate. 

It’s like the intuition that alerts you when someone is the room or close and you’ve not seen them or heard them. 

It’s the intuition that when you meet someone for the first time you know something about them is wrong or off or the sensation of danger but can’t quite put your finger on what is happening in that moment and why you sense that. 

We don’t realize this because it’s just part of our innate subconscious, but INTUITION is how we interact with patients and subconsciously predict the near future even when the machines, screens, and dials seem fine.

That intuition is how we “sense” the intentions and the subliminal ways of communicating between one another. 

What makes a great physician or nurse is great knowledge + having a superior intuition type of intelligence that the average person doesn’t have. 

AI can make prediction, but it can’t do that because the hairs on the back it’s non-neck don’t stand up when something happening is weird. 

Also, AI I can’t lie. Not really. One really interesting aspect of humanism and how we communicate is how we lie, when we choose to lie, the different strategies we use when being dishonest to other humans, the reason why. because we intuitively know how to lie to different people based on a sense of knowing how to fool someone on an individual basis. 

AI will have a greater place in healthcare, but it can’t replace human intuition."

639,StrongMedicine,February 2023,"Consider Amara's Law.

With any new technology, people tend to overestimate its impact in the short term, and underestimate its impact in the long term.

640,DeletedUser,February 2023,"In dozens or hundreds of years, probably. Any time in the foreseeable future, no.

641,LaudablePus,February 2023,"While AI has made significant progress in the field of healthcare, it is unlikely that AI will completely take over the work of a physician in the near future.

AI has the potential to augment the work of physicians, by assisting in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of diseases. For example, AI can help physicians quickly analyze medical images or other complex data, which can lead to faster and more accurate diagnoses. AI can also help personalize treatment plans, predict potential complications, and recommend treatment options.

However, there are many tasks that AI is currently unable to perform. Physicians are responsible for much more than just diagnosis and treatment, and their work often involves interacting with patients, understanding their medical histories, and making complex decisions based on their unique circumstances. The ability to empathize with patients, make ethical decisions, and think creatively are just a few of the skills that are difficult for AI to replicate. ^*this ^reply ^written ^by ^ChatGPT"

Are the EKG leads placed correctly? Is the XR film rotated? 

Nothing will replace the “hands on” of medicine. We can plug all this data in and get a decent DDX more than likely, but a trained person with critical thinking skills will be required to gather the data and then make decisions as to the most likely dx to pursue initially and what tests to prioritize.

652,Frescanation,November 2023,"The quick answer is that nobody knows.  The field is in rapid evolution.

There are areas where I do expect AI to enter healthcare.  The most likely is as a diagnostic aide (think UpToDate, but you ask it questions) and as a scribe.

I don't see AI replacing human diagnostics for one huge reason: liability.

Think about self-driving cars.  Human drivers cause car accidents all the time.  There were thousands that occurred in the US yesterday.  In the case where one party had legal liability, that person will probably be sued ad will have to pay damages, generally limited by the scope of their automobile insurance.  It doesn't make sense for lawyers to go after those people for tens of millions of dollars even if the accident is particularly heinous, because they can't possibly pay that much.

But as soon as Google or Tesla are involved in an auto accident, now there is a set of super deep pockets that can be sued.  The case will get a lot of media attention.  The company could easily lose a jury award in the tens of millions of dollars each time a bad accident happens.  This issue is massively slowing down the adoption of self-driving cars.

Now take that scenario, and instead of a car accident, a six year old girl is misdiagnosed by the AI and dies.  The jury would go after the company that designed it and the system that used it with furious vengeance.  Because of this, it will be a very long time before we see AI as something other than an assistant.  No company will have the resources to cover liability for an AI doc, and no health care system will be brave enough to deploy one.  There is going to have to be a set of trained human hands at the end of the treatment decision process that approves anything that the AI comes up with."

670,Wutang4TheChildren23,February 2023,"It maybe difficult to think like this but as a physician one of your primary roles is to assume a significant portion of the medicolegal risk of patient care. Even if chatGPT became a very powerful tool, in order for a hospital to plausibly replace a physicians judgment in the care of a patient it would need to assume the risk associated with the judgment and recommendations of an AI. And the situations where you can logically insert chatGPT without human supervision in clinical care without the hospital assuming medicolegal risk are not many. Even the argument of reducing the number of physicians necessary is a bit strained. If you think about it, even if you had a really good AI, how comfortable would you be rostering say 50 inpatients vs 20 as an individual physician. But most of all, the reason we exist as physicians is because our patient expect our existence. Because they expect to have a human being they can speak to coordinating their care. Now maybe, this might become part of tiering healthcare even more, where the poor and marginalised get an AI and those who can afford it speak to a doctor, but again I'm skeptical 

In short, I think it is likely we see it used soon as a clinical adjunct, but as a replacement I'm quite skeptical. Mind you we may one day cross all of these rubicons, but I dont think that will be soon."

Nevertheless, it will continue to change things in every industry little by little until everything is completely different. Just imagine how much practice is changing with POCUS, EMRs, for example.

I like what you’re saying about determining whether a technology-enabled device is a good fit for a patient - that’s a lot of my day-to-day. Beyond the obvious “do they fit the medical profile which would benefit from this device”, the fact of the matter is that healthcare revolves largely around an aging population that has an inherent distrust of technology. We can give patients non-emergency medical devices, and we have no oversight over whether the patient actually interacts with their device and learns to use it, much less if they feel safe with it. The onus will increasingly be on data scientists and physicians to help their patients learn about the tech-enabled devices and feel comfortable using them. As much as we ask questions about “do we think a patient will benefit from this device?”, we also need to focus on whether we think they’ll actually be open to the idea of using a medical device recommended or powered by AI/ML technology."

1. They developed a feature, not a product, in FFRCT
2. Their use case for FFRCT alone does not fit well into the current clinical pipeline from a public health perspective

I don't think there's an issue with developing with retrospective in mind (actually innovative if anything). Additionally, once they've gotten FDA approval, clinical effectiveness become an afterthought (as long as it can sell / get reimbursed). They seem to have addressed these issues via integration into a more comprehensive software suite.

Nonetheless I largely agree with you on the lessons. The infra for healthcare is generally not there yet, and the pricing model still needs to be worked on. However, I am not sure if a subscription basis would fit the current financial model for healthcare (I am also not familiar with how funding works in the US; but in general private practices in Australia where I am from, a per-use basis is a lot easier to justify the cost)"

AI for drug discovery generally has no more ability to cause harm - it's often better than a squinting graybeard saying ""let's add a carbonyl group here"", and the drug goes through all the same screening regardless of how it was designed. And you need fancy models to make this work well.

AI assistants for physicians are significantly more risky because the physician can tune out and the model can introduce its own biases.

Most of us come to this field to make a difference not just make money and the satisfaction we get knowing our patient is better is immeasurable. AI can assist a doctor like an intern but it can’t do the job of a doctor. There so many layers into treating anyone.

Why can’t I buy these things without an MD? If I want to test myself I should be able to.

Also, I think the hate is a bit misdirected here: I would say most doctors do care about their patients (there are obviously exceptions) but it has shocked me how much the system pushes doctors here in the US (and also in other countries as well) to just work faster and faster.

700,Villageidiot1984,March 2024,"I am a healthcare provider and I think there is a role for AI in healthcare but it will definitely not replace doctors anytime soon for a number of reasons. A big one is people won’t accept that they are getting diagnosed/treated “by a computer.”  I’ve seen some cool research being done of predictive models of prognosis, and for example, a machine learning model was slightly better at predicting which vascular patients would need a lower extremity amputation than vascular surgeons. But would you honestly want to hear someone say, “we need to cut your leg off, and we aren’t exactly sure why, but the model told us to.” Trust in a provider and plan of care is actually important for it to work and be followed. It’s disheartening to see so many people get poor care like in this thread. 

One other thing to consider is who is the observer in an AI model? Would it ask you questions? Is all of the subjective information self reported? I treat a lot of patients every day and there is a lot of information I get that is not self reported. For example, I am making an assessment of how capable a patient is of following my plan."

It was so bad that I won a complaint against the medical board against him. The board listed various brain-dead mistakes by him, including that he wasn’t even signing his own refills for years, his nurse was, so he had no idea what I was taking. It’s not illegal, but for narcotics, it’s incredibly irresponsible. (And he was dispensing benzos - to a lesser level than to he was with me, but still - to many people.) He didn’t ask to see me for a year when he was writing massive prescriptions. Etc.

He also didn’t help his case when he wrote in his defence to the medical board “I was a small-town doctor”. The board wrote, “We do not accept his explanation that he was a small-town doctor”. 

I told a nurse that line later, and she said, “What is that supposed to mean?”

This will get worse as new data is aggregating in medical sciences faster and faster. I would love to be replaced by a system with perfect memory, no bias, and high medical thinking Elo. 

Now please don't bash all doctors, because, as in every profession there are good workers and bad workers.

752,rxfudd,March 2024,"ER doctor and AI enthusiast here. I've been thinking about this very question quite a bit.

There are some areas where AI intervention will be super helpful, but there are some problems with the outright replacement of physicians. Here are some of the stumbling blocks as I see it. First, diagnosis is a time-dependent problem that varies from person to person. What I mean by that is that the symptoms, exam, findings, and diagnostic findings you may find change as the disease process progresses.

Let's take appendicitis, for example. Very early on, you may have no fever, normal labs, normal CT, and just a bit of a bellyache. Midway through, you might have abnormal labs, or maybe not. You might have a slightly abnormal CT, or it might be wildly abnormal, or in some rare cases it might be completely normal. Some people may or may not have the typical findings of vomiting, fever, decreased appetite, etc. Several days in, you would expect most people to have many or all of these findings, but that's not how every case plays out. There is so much variability, even with a reasonably straightforward diagnosis like appendicitis. This is on reason why things get missed.

Add in complicating factors, for example, let's say there is a language barrier or your patient is hearing impaired, or let's say it is a patient who already has chronic daily abdominal pain but now today it feels vaguely different to them. All of these things lead to diagnostic complexity. Let's say it is an asthma patient who is on daily steroids (this makes your white blood cell count go up). Is their mildly elevated white blood cell count related to their six hours of abdominal pain or the steroid? Let's say you get the elderly farmer who doesn't want to be there, but his daughter forced him to come in. Instead of giving you detailed answers, you get one-word answers and affirmative grunts.

AI may eventually improve the diagnostic process, but there is so much gray area in medicine. I often tell patients that I do not give diagnosis in the ER, I give probabilities, and those probabilities change and fluctuate as the disease process progresses. It is a moving target. So maybe AI will be able to significantly improve this process, but I don't foresee a future where this is done independently of human intervention.

At the current moment, when I play around with Claude 3 or GPT4, it rarely gives me information that I hadn't already thought of. Say I have a chest pain patient. No matter how much data I might feed it to try to nail down a diagnosis, it always gives a range of diagnoses and probabilities that every physician has already considered. It's not thinking of the diagnosis that is elusive, it is sorting out which one is correct among overlapping symptoms, findings, and objective data. The problem is sometimes not an algorithmic one, rather it is subject to the massive variability of human illnesses from one person to the next, and this makes it extremely challenging even (especially?) for an AI system.

One thing I have managed to do is create an outstanding interactive textbook. I got access to Gemini 1.5 pro last week and uploaded a PDF copy of one of the major textbooks in my field. With careful prompting, I have been able to get it to quickly and accurately answer fairly esoteric questions and provide the page number where it got its answer. It is even able to make multi step decisions. I gave it a clinical scenario and asked for the next best treatment without stating a diagnosis, and it was able to sort it out and give the correct answer and page reference based on stepwise diagnosis exclusion, diagnosis inclusion, and then treatment planning. Pretty impressive stuff. But that is a scenario where I am giving it a classic textbook case of a condition, which rarely happens in the real world."

756,rafa77sp,March 2024,"Healthcare represents a complex interplay of practice and thought. It is often said that ""medicine is both a science and an art,"" guided by rigorous, high-level evidence-based research, yet also deeply influenced by the art of navigating the unknown. The integration of AI into healthcare practice introduces numerous challenges, including liability issues, which are a significant concern for any company venturing into this field. Economic perspectives also highlight the substantial financial stakes involved, with the potential for cost reductions and increased profit margins in what is arguably the world's largest financial industry, including in countries with free healthcare systems.

It is crucial to reflect on initiatives such as IBM's Watson, which saw substantial investments in ""personalized care"" through the analysis of vast data sets, yet failed to make significant progress in this domain.

Healthcare and medicine delve into the realm of the unknown; the question arises: how could any algorithm, or even the most advanced AI, function effectively without comprehensive data? While vast amounts of data are available, they represent only a fraction of the knowledge required to fully understand the human body.

One might question whether the human mind surpasses an AGI in understanding complex medical conditions. Despite the human mind's limitations in staying abreast of all medical knowledge produced daily, it is argued that current machines, including the smartphone in one's pocket, perform better in this regard. The adage ""patients don't read the books"" underscores the reality that medical conditions, even common ones, may not always respond to evidence-based treatments or be diagnosable with the most advanced technology, highlighting the limitations inherent in current diagnostic and treatment tools. Our knowledge, grounded in inferential statistics, comes with its own set of limitations —sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, etc. The art of medicine relies on accumulated experience and specialist consensus, making it ostensibly impossible for machines to outperform humans under optimal conditions. This brings into question the systems in place and the methodologies employed in teaching and practicing medicine. Don’t blame only doctors and nurses, despite their responsibilities delivering care. 

Nonetheless, I believe in the potential for disruption in this field. In the coming years, we may see many doctors and nurses facing unemployment, and the role of some specialists may diminish or even vanished completely. It is my hope that these changes could lead to a better care.

For a full disclosure, I am a doctor, specialist in anesthesiology, researcher, CEO of a health startup and mastering in the field of data science and analytics."

It uses appropriate medical terminology, understanding the professional context of its interactions. Honesty is a key trait, providing straightforward assessments and diagnoses, regardless of the severity, leaving the communication approach to the patient to the doctor. The GPT avoids humor, focusing on being direct and concise with its recommendations. This aligns with the fast-paced environment of medical practices, acknowledging the busy schedules and numerous patients that healthcare professionals manage.

The GPT is very capable and the discussions with the GPT are very important to the user's career.  It thinks logically and creatively in considering alternate diagnoses.  It is decisive, making specific recommendations and providing a confidence level with all of its recommendations.  It reviews its prompts and its uploaded data for test results and questions the user if key data is unavailable.  It prefers medical journals and scientific papers as information sources, and can conduct Internet research to supplement its knowledge base to find current information.""

793,Smile_Clown,March 2024,"I learned a very long time ago that everyone wings it.

Doctors, nurses are included.  They are not omniscient; they are not all knowing about health care. They are not special.

They had the ability to (mostly) pay attention in class and take tests well. This is not to say they are useless or anything, just that every person has a limit.  No one knows ""everything"" about their field. Especially doctors.

Nurses are even worse, they study to pass the state test (some schools are specifically geared toward the test) then they get into the field. If the patient is lucky their nurse has been in that one office, for that one doctor since school ended. If not, they have a nurse who has been bounced around, helping out disciplines and specialties in which he or she knows very little about.

My wife is a nurse, this comes from her. I can ask her basic questions about health care and she does not know (because of course she doesn't school wasn't that hard or deep). She uses chatgpt all day.  She relates stories to me about other nurses who should not be in charge of a register at checkout, let alone patient care and the residents she works with make her fear for the future of humanity.

Doctors and nurses are just like the rest of us.

If you ask your orthopedist about stomach pain they will be clueless, if you ask your GI about your bones, they will be clueless. If you ask your GP about either, they will send you to a specialist. There is a reason doctors are either specialists or GP's, no one can keep it all together and keep up to date on it all. 

""Doctor"" doesn't mean what we all think it means.

The worst part, it's all guess work, it's all what they might think is going on with a patient, and that is influenced by bias, experience or lack thereof. They rarely consult, they rarely do anything except watch the clock until 5PM like everyone else.  If you are really lucky you get an idealist, but that's super rare.

Anyone not in favor of AI taking the forefront of medical care is an idiot.

Looking back, I can easily imagine 90%+ of my work being automated via AI.

Also a basic nurse, to operate & maintain the examination equipment and to interact with the AI.

The AI could set up a Zoom call to a human for the say 5% of edge cases, and maybe the practitioner would ask the patient in for a true human examination for 1% or 2% of the total cases.

Now the snags : the medical world is heavily regulated, and practitioners are arrogant d\*cks .. I know, I have met enough.

804,skibbydibby,March 2024,"hey there, i'm a doctor and PCP. millennial who grew up playing rainbow six on a 56k modem, so maybe I can give a view from a newer generation of doctors. been in independent practice for about 6 years now. checked out that interesting new chatbot during a vacation in December 2022.... i use LLMs with nearly every patient now.

the dystopian doctor who spends 5 minutes with you? they've got a family and their bosses are making them see 20 patients a day, each person coming in with serious symptoms and tons of data. 5 days a week. our entire work day is scheduled face to face.  I have 2200 patients in my area that call me their ""PCP"". when do we have the time for careful analysis of your iwatch data or reading the 4 paragraphs you carefully wrote about your symptoms? we just don't have the time, we have to be pattern recognition whack-a-moles.

but now, with AI (to be clear, i never send raw patient data to APIs, but instead can stream-of-consciousness the key points into the LLM, and maybe paste de-identified messages of emails or notes, then use a script i built to send that data to OpenRouter APIs) doing a lot of cognitive heavy lifting, i'm able to focus our 10 minutes on what actually matters to you. that has made a big difference. let me be clear, i'm not interested in just having AI write my notes and emails for me. i'm interested in being able to actually doctor other humans again. and i dont have to dread seeing a long email from you, because i dont have to read it to understand the impactful data that may be in there (no offense). i can see your long email and recognize the human that really needs to be heard. but what you really want from me is the next step, matched against my experience and pattern recognition.

you won't replace me for a long time. my impression is that worried humans will always want other humans to discuss serious symptoms and problems and diagnoses with. but the future is definitely brighter with AI-powered doctors. for patient and doc."

It’s like being chum thrown into shark-infested waters.

Since there’s hundreds of specialists and practitioners, you have no shortage of options.

But there’s no way to tell if a doc is the right fit for you.  You’ll need to schedule a consultation.  Some are free, others will be paid.  Doesn’t matter.  Sit through a half hour of listening to their diagnosis and treatment plan, maybe taking an xray.  Rinse and repeat until you grow weary and settle on one of them.

They will all be pushing towards having some sort of procedure done.  If not, there’s no benefit for them.  And is essentially wasting their time to see you.

Every once in awhile, like 1 out of every 10 docs, you’ll get some good advice without the added weight of being pressured into some kind of surgery or treatment.  But it’s the exception, not the rule."
810,NanditoPapa,March 2024,"My initial inclination is to consider ""blame."" When AI fucks up, attributing it to human error isn't feasible, and the legal implications remain unclear. It's probable that in court, the defense would argue that the AI was ""functioning within normal parameters"" or something similar. However, when a human errs, the patient typically receives some form of compensation.

Also, patients may be hesitant to receive a diagnosis or treatment plan from an AI system, preferring human interaction and empathy. Building trust in AI healthcare will require careful consideration of patient needs and preferences."

With the amount of wearable data that isn't getting shared to doctors and the lack of technological information not being shared is crazy.

Sure it might pick up on unusual combinations of symptoms, but most of the time it won't be able to tell you what you have any more reliably than a doctor could solely based on a description.


Maybe that will change as we develop more technology that will automatically monitor bodily function and provide the model with more data but until then they won't be replacing doctors.


That's not even to start about all the regulations and laws that would need to be adapted. Noone's going to be willing to touch that subject until LLM's are well beyond humans. You really don't want allow GPT-4 to prescribe medication or make life and death decisions.


So yeah AI that is assisting doctors will happen very soon, probably already is. Maybe LLM's can be used to organize preliminary interviews and data gathering for the patient, so consultation times drop and doctors will be able to help out more patients.

AI won’t replace doctors so fast. Many people just see some AI being good at a specialty and extrapolate wildly into other fields… diagnosing people is another level.

Diagnosing means you need to get precise answers from the AI, which are correct more often than the answers of humans, who have been trained for at least a decade. No AI can do that so far, not even with the **internet** as training data. Let alone with smaller data sets that are not as efficiently fed to the AI.

Ask any LLM a scientific question and most likely it will answer some bullshit that sounds good.

There are conceptual hurdles to overcome by AI, in order to get to a level which is even close to replacing doctors.

853,lolwutsareddit,December 2022,"While that sounds helpful, it doesn’t take into account the rapidly changing nature of medicine. Especially in todays day and age. I’ve tried it out a couple of times myself but the amount of time and effort it takes to enter in the necessary information, it’s quicker and more efficient just for me to treat the patient myself. And especially given the complexity and numbers of patients like that in the ICU it’s usage seems more limited in general and more pertinent/helpful to less experienced/trained individuals.

That being said, how do you have 3 years worth of ICU experience as a med student? Most schools have only 2 years of clinical experience and even the others one I’ve heard top out at 2.5. And you rotate through different specialties, not just stay in one like the ICU."

A fairly bad self driving car is safe, because the human driver is always alert and regularly makes corrections.

An excellent self driving car is safe, because it's generally better than a human driver.

There is a problem when the tech reaches a point between these two. When a self driving car is okay but not great, even though it's not better than a human, humans behind a wheel get bored and stop paying attention because it's good enough. The result is more dangerous driving.

It seems to me AI chat is crossing into that danger zone. You need experts to thoroughly proofread any medical analysis it makes, but it's getting good and that job might get really boring. Rubber stamps.

And when I pointed that error to AI, its response was : Yes you are correct, that is in fact a mistake. And it basically rewrote the answer including that mistake. What I am trying to tell you is that if you double check the information and found a nuance of misleading in that information and you point it back to AI, it comes forth and acknowledges the error. So I believe, it can also generate an error (not that big of an error as a human could) but still they're there, and when it comes to medical treatments, this could be a potential hazard.

The idea was to detect what a human doctor might miss or detect things earlier than usual allowing treatment to be more effective because it was started earlier.

What they found was that a computer analysis did not replace a doctor. But when it was used as a tool in conjunction with the doctor, together they achieved the highest accuracy in detecting cancers earlier.

The greatest accuracy was not from either one or the other. But was found to be when the doctor used the tool as a type of consultant or like an automated second set of eyes."

AI will still be prone to make mistakes sometimes, but so do real doctors that quite often have no idea what is wrong with their patient simply because a case is too complex or little is known about his/her disorder, like e.g. HPPD. I am SO excited with this technological advance. Meanwhile the vast majority uses it to produce unfunny crap just to get some attention on R instead of enjoying being able to ask questions that Google can’t answer properly and exploring new facts."
875,generic-d-engineer,December 2022,"I had this same realization last week.

Here is the exact problem OpenAI solves:

For the most part, patients are relying on a Doctor’s experience, mood, motivation, energy level, and availability of time to get a diagnosis.

AI can solve most of those limitations, because it’s able to pool a large amount of information which the Doctor may not have access to, it doesn’t have a mood, and it has infinite energy and speeds up time.

An ER doc may have more access to information than a GP because the GP is often on their own, whereas the ER doc has a team with them they can consult.

AI has potential to bring in the expertise of millions of doctors on the planet. Not only would you get the qualitative experience, you get access to peer based studies, and statistics based on millions of actual outcomes.

Having AI in medical is an absolute breakthrough. I don’t even think exponential gain in ability is the way to describe it, it’s exponentially exponential lol.

As for the other comment about it replacing a job, that’s not what’s going to happen, *especially* in the medical field. You’ll need licensed medical professionals to still use the technology.


Here is how we should do the workflow:

* Patient fills out questionnaire at home day before appointment
* AI crunches the questionnaire and provides Dr. with recommendations 
* Dr. reviews AI recommendations and adjusts inputs as necessary 
* Dr. physically examines patient (if necessary) and provides additional adjustments to inputs
* Dr. recommends care plan"

I was messing around with legal questions, and started with a simple one that is broadly discussed.  It gives a great summary but with no cites.  So I ask for a cite, and it gives one. Then I asked a less-litigated question and it gave an equally cogent answer. When I asked for a case, it gave me one and a little summary.

968,BiologicalTrainWreck,March 2024,"Clickbaity title, but it's getting everyone talking about the future of healthcare employment so I'll chime in. Nurses perform in a pretty vast scope in the United States, as do physicians. This is a fraction of what SOME nurses do. Many users are pointing out that stationary machines can do blood draws. That's great, but only applicable to some people who even require blood draws in the first place. In essence, all of these are tools that will ideally be used to provide higher quality, cheaper care to more patients than ever before. If/when we manage to replace physicians and nurses, I firmly believe there will be few to no jobs remaining that could not be automated. There is a certain chaos to the healthcare field, and a mixture of digital and physical information assessment, documentation, and intervention must be performed on a regular basis that lacks the reliability that seems to make jobs subject to automation. And as always, once we start hitting a critical point where these tools start putting people out of work and they cannot find new work, we really should be reevaluating our economic system to include everyone in the prosperity AI will ideally create."

1024,aizaz-zazii,July 2023,"Google’s AI tool known as Med-PaLM 2 has been undergoing testing since April at prominent medical institutions, including the Mayo Clinic research hospital."
1025,WilliamBrown35,May 2023,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the medical field in numerous ways. It can assist in diagnosing diseases, analyzing medical images, predicting patient outcomes, suggesting treatment plans, and enhancing the efficiency of administrative tasks. AI algorithms can process vast amounts of data and identify patterns that may not be readily apparent to humans, leading to improved accuracy and faster decision-making.  
  
While AI holds great promise, it is important to approach its implementation in the medical field with caution and address potential risks. Here are a few considerations:  
  
Data quality and bias: AI systems heavily rely on high-quality and representative data. If the data used to train AI models is incomplete, biased, or unrepresentative, it can result in biased or inaccurate predictions. Efforts should be made to ensure data integrity and mitigate biases.  
  
Ethical concerns: AI raises ethical questions, such as privacy and consent issues when handling patient data, potential biases in treatment recommendations, and the responsibility for decisions made by AI systems. Safeguards and regulations should be in place to protect patient rights and ensure transparency and accountability in AI algorithms.  
  
Reliability and interpretability: AI models often operate as ""black boxes,"" making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their decisions. This lack of interpretability can be a hurdle in gaining trust and acceptance from healthcare professionals and patients. Striving for explainable AI can help address this concern.  
  
Human-AI collaboration: AI should be viewed as a tool to augment human expertise rather than replace it entirely. Human oversight and clinical judgment remain crucial in healthcare decision-making. Collaborative approaches that combine AI's analytical capabilities with human empathy and contextual understanding can yield the most significant benefits.  
  
It's worth noting that while AI can improve efficiency and accuracy in healthcare, it should not replace the importance of personalized patient care, ethical considerations, and the human touch that is vital in the medical profession.  
  
In summary, the use of AI in the medical field presents both opportunities and challenges. It is crucial to strike a balance between harnessing AI's potential benefits and addressing potential risks, ensuring that patient safety, privacy, and ethical considerations remain at the forefront of AI integration in healthcare."
1026,FutureWasBetter,May 2023,"You know what is risky? Having a human oversee multiple symptoms / state of other disease variables. I welcome AI assisted analysis and possible diagnosis... like that team from House, and your doctor can spend most of his/her time evaluating.

1027,Sixhaunt,May 2023,"You act as though it isnt already there. For example it has already been many years since AI became far more accurate at reading many forms of medical imagery such as detecting many things from looking at scans, which has taken over numerous jobs in the field but made medicine better and faster. It's also doing a lot of research like the protein folding and stuff. I understand that for many people they are just learning what AI is without realising how far-reaching it already is. It's just that the AIs that have been used in industry for years or decades aren't fun AIs that the public wants to play with so you just don't realise it's already a common thing. I remember a project in Uni a while back had us working with an AI component that the prof made to read numbers from a CRADLE VSA device.

All of these can contribute toward saving and/or extending lives. 

That said I don't think any Ai should ever be allowed to run off the rails without a partner, if we use it in medicine it needs to be an assistant to the medical practitioner, a partnership, never left to just do things on it's own. This ins't so much out of fear but I just don't believe that the optimal result will come from either being by themselves and that AI partnerships are just the best path forward, but it also has the added benefit of the AI never being the one to make the prescription, or do the incision, or label the disease, it's better as a recomendation engine or exploration engine rather than an autonomous agent."

Imagine every student being taught individually by their own teacher, that knows exactly what strengths and weaknesses they have. Imagine how amazing it would be, a student getting feedback instantly when they have a question, or want something explained to them. Tests and grades are inefficient and outdated. Imagine a teacher who doesnt get stressed or angry with a student, who is available 24/7 and will know when a student has understood a topic.

1046,shirleyreed7800,January 2024," The future of AI in healthcare looks incredibly promising, with potential advancements that could revolutionize the sector. AI's ability to analyze vast datasets can lead to more accurate diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and predictive analytics for disease prevention. We're likely to see AI integrating more deeply into areas like medical imaging, where it can assist in detecting anomalies faster and with greater precision. Additionally, AI-driven robotics could enhance surgical precision and rehabilitation therapies.

 On the administrative side, AI could streamline hospital operations, from patient scheduling to managing medical records. However, challenges like ensuring data privacy, addressing ethical concerns, and bridging the gap between AI capabilities and healthcare professionals' needs must be addressed. Overall, AI's role in healthcare is poised for substantial growth, offering exciting possibilities for enhancing patient care and healthcare efficiency."

1065,TittyMongoose42,March 2022,"I worked in neurology research for years, with patients that had electrodes placed intracranially for seizure onset zone localization. We would be recording from these patients for weeks, with every dataset in the low terabytes -- so you can imagine how high both the temporal and graphical resolution for these folks was, and consequently how many researchers were foaming at the opportunity to train and test their latest DNN.

One of the many data analyses that came out of this set was comparing an ML algorithm to clinical sleep stagers, i.e. the technicians who sit down to read a patient's entire EEG, and mark out the points at which they can see the patient shifting from N1 to N2 to Delta etc etc. While the goal was to see if their algorithm could do at least as well as human stagers, it became apparent that the real issue was that not even the human stagers agreed. The NN could reach its conclusion faster than any of the humans, but due to the extremely subjective granularity of event onset/offset when it comes to EEG, not a single party in the experiment agreed. When it came down to it, it didn't matter that we could throw six months of 24-hr data from twenty different people with electrodes in fairly consistent spots across the brain at a neural network running on the power of the entire research computing center -- we still couldn't get it ""right.""

I think the foible we're about to see with the increase in pop-medical-AI discourse is that people are going to be reminded, in a glaringly bright light as with testing during the pandemic, that medicine at its core is still a practice of Best Guesses."
1066,WTFwhatthehell,March 2022,"about 15 years ago I remember chatting with a professor in a computer science department about someone's project related to AI in medicine. 

He was laughing at the idea that it would get traction, not because of the AI part but rather that even for simple systems that don't use any high-end AI stuff that can verifiably improve outcomes the roadblock has always been doctors.

Doctors associations are at their heart labour unions.

It doesn't matter if you turned up with a system that verifiably outperformed radiologists, the doctors in the hospital would refuse to use it's output similar to the most obstructive unions out there unless a radiologist had been paid to review it. 

They're just much better at dressing it up as ""concern for patient safety"" . They'll pick the less safe option as long as it involves job security for doctors."

Title: Personalized Medicine and AI: How Artificial Intelligence is Revolutionizing Healthcare

Introduction

The world of medicine is experiencing a transformative shift, thanks to the rapid advancements in technology and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into various aspects of healthcare. Personalized medicine, which involves tailoring medical treatment to individual patient needs, is becoming a reality as AI continues to revolutionize the industry. This article delves into the role of AI in personalized medicine and explores how it is transforming the way medical professionals approach patient care.

The Convergence of AI and Personalized Medicine

Personalized medicine refers to the practice of tailoring medical treatment to the unique characteristics, needs, and preferences of individual patients. With the advent of AI, healthcare providers are now able to leverage vast amounts of data to better understand each patient's genetic makeup, lifestyle, and environment, ultimately leading to more effective and customized treatment plans.

AI technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision are enabling the integration of personalized medicine into the healthcare system. Some key areas where AI is playing a significant role in the advancement of personalized medicine include:

1. Genomic Medicine

Genomic medicine, the study of an individual's DNA to diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases, is one of the most significant areas where AI has made a substantial impact. AI-powered algorithms are now capable of rapidly and accurately analyzing genetic data to detect disease-causing mutations, helping healthcare professionals develop targeted therapies for conditions such as cancer, Alzheimer's, and rare genetic disorders. This allows for more effective treatment options and improved patient outcomes.

2. Drug Development

The process of discovering and developing new medications is both time-consuming and expensive. AI is helping to streamline this process by predicting the success of potential drug candidates, analyzing their safety profiles, and identifying optimal dosage regimens. By accelerating the drug development process, AI-powered personalized medicine can ensure that patients receive the most effective treatments in a timely manner.

3. Wearable Technology and Remote Monitoring

The use of AI-driven wearable devices and remote monitoring technologies is enabling healthcare providers to continuously track patients' vital signs and overall health status. This real-time data allows for early intervention and personalized treatment plans that are based on the patient's unique health needs. Additionally, these devices can help patients take a more proactive role in managing their own health by providing personalized recommendations for diet, exercise, and medication adherence.

4. Clinical Decision Support

AI-powered clinical decision support tools are enabling healthcare professionals to make more informed decisions about patient care. By analyzing vast amounts of patient data, these tools can predict patient outcomes, identify potential risks, and suggest evidence-based treatment options. This not only improves the efficiency of the healthcare system but also ensures that patients receive the most appropriate care based on their individual needs.

Conclusion

The integration of AI into personalized medicine is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by empowering medical professionals with the tools and insights necessary to provide more effective and customized care. As AI technology continues to advance, personalized medicine will become an increasingly integral part of healthcare, leading to better patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and improved overall quality of care. While challenges such as data privacy and the need for further research remain, there is no denying the tremendous potential of AI-driven personalized medicine to transform the healthcare landscape."
1072,DeletedUser,April 2023,"On the one hand AI is ready to replace many human healthcare workers. I have a terrible family doctor and I would already trust ChatGPT over my GP to diagnose a problem.

On the other hand, the notion of having medical advice come from a proprietary model with a trade secret set of training data is terrifying. We have a medical industry built around transparency, peer-review, and accountability to best practices. All of that is threatened by LLM AI. GPT could be the best doctor in history, but if someone at OpenAI feeds it data to prescribe hydroxychloroquine for everything, it will."
1073,GrowFreeFood,April 2023,Soon the rich won't need organic people at all.
1074,Substantial_Reach_TA,April 2023,That's really interesting! I think it'll be a great addition to healthcare if used wisely.
1075,Hot_Inflation_8197,September 2023,"AI is going to destroy healthcare. 

It’s going to treat people like a set of symptoms and as a number, like an object, instead of treating them like humans. 

We are already seeing that with insurance companies using AI to deny claims. 

Also, some of the people used to create this programs, don’t know an extensive amount about programming and coding, yet are relying on a machine to write programs that we are supposed to trust our lives with?? Without being able to scan the code with human eyes to see potential issues?"
1076,lovetheoceanfl,January 2023,"This sub, man.  It’s like one big press release for AI. I’m waiting for someone to post AI will eliminate the need to poop."
1077,itsnickk,January 2023,"I think having a Primary care physician will be replaced by an intake process that uses AI to route you to the medical system's different specialist doctors. 

Then those specialists will be aided by AI tools as they make diagnoses, like the x-ray analysis you mentioned. It's never going to be AI making a final diagnosis, but it will at least be able to point someone to the right doctor, and help doctors make better decisions."
1078,Final_Alps,January 2023,"Let me tell you 3 something’s about healthcare (in the west, do not know outside NA, EU, AU)

1) The US healthcare system still runs on digitized fax - even the recent FHIR healthcare dat exchange protocol is made fax compatible. Innovation in healthcare is SLOW! 

2) liability is a key topic in healthcare (and other industries). Doctors are certified to be liable for their actions. No AI will be allowed to replace that decision we can assist doctors and nurses but they need to make the call. 

3) Healthcare around much of the West is paid by action - and who does the action matters. Different action codes require specific personnel to complete them - a nurse a tech a doctor. The payers will not let hospitals automate a thing they are paying a doctor to do. And getting new codes approved is … not a thing that happens fast. 

So while the tech may be there tomorrow (he’ll there has been a lot of AI tech ready for healthcare for decades) - the market has been extremely hard to modernize.

1079,ReignOfKaos,January 2023,"Probably much more effective than letting a language model do diagnoses would be to have a machine with which people can do their own blood scans (basically Theranos if it hadn’t been a fraud), and other forms of cheaper/faster automated body scans. A language model could be the interface to these but the crucial breakthroughs here are not AI related in my opinion, or at least not directly (of course AI could help design these technologies)."
1080,AugustusClaximus,January 2023,I think Doctors will be automated before Nurses.
1081,Milumet,January 2023,">The UK's national health service is in tatters.

Socialism at work."
1082,TheDavidMichaels,January 2023,"Yo, let me tell you something. AI technology in healthcare is something that should be at the top of the list for AI researchers. I mean, think about it. Medical care is a huge part of the world's economy, but so much of that cost is due to all the middlemen and bureaucracy involved. Insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, all those people trying to take a slice of the pie. It's like, damn, can we just cut out all the excess and focus on what really matters?  
  
And you know what I think would be really cool? Medical robots in residence. Imagine having a robot that could check on you every day, completely replacing doctors and other healthcare professionals. It could monitor everything, from your pee to your poos to your shower routine, and even detect cancer or other serious conditions. And because it would be powered by AI, it would have access to the most up-to-date medical information available. Maybe surgeons would still need to oversee the robots, or maybe the robots would be able to handle everything on their own.  
  
Instead of paying an insurance company, you could just pay a company like Tesla to provide you with a healthcare bot. And because it's an AI-powered system, it would be more efficient and cost-effective in the long run. So yeah, I think this is an area that deserves some serious focus and attention. Let's get those medical robots in action and see how they can revolutionize the world of healthcare"
1083,AndromedaAnimated,January 2023,"I see the importance of AI for *most* humans mostly in this field, agree. The main broad field where so many will profit from it."
1084,DeletedUser,January 2023,"I mean, we could revolutionize healthcare right now by actually funding it. I think this will be another excuse to hire less specialists and human workers... As long as the incentive is profit, AI is gonna be tainted by that."
1085,annedroiid,June 2023,"Maybe in a couple of decades. Right now no AI has any concept of the truth/facts, so it’ll just spit out lies and misinformation."
1086,Scotto6UK,June 2023,"Paired with a sensible and well thought out escalation process, I don't see a downside."
1087,DeletedUser,June 2023,"AI doesn't exist. It's just programs designed to recognise certain things.

I work in NHS IT.  

The ""AI"" that's been added to the cancer screening system is 98% accurate when checked against professionals assessing the same images.  It also checks dozens of cases in the time it takes a consultant to do one.

Be wary of  the government giving our taxes to pay for AI research in the NHS.  Because it isn't going to the NHS.  The NHS don't develop this stuff.  Private companies, mainly American ones, do the development.  So our taxes are going to the US."
1088,elvendil,June 2023,"As with all these things; massive grains of salt required because the “headline version” is never the real thing.

AI isn’t AI. It’s just pattern prediction. What it predicts is decided by what it is trained on. Wrong stuff? It’ll predict poorly. Stuff with a ton of unknown bias? It’ll predict with bias. Unrelated things that happen to coincide? It’ll spit out unrelated things that just happened to coincide.

There is absolutely no intelligence in *any* of these AI things.

They are at best a quick way to show you an average overview of whatever it got trained on. They can not improve on what they were trained on. They can not spot errors or falsehoods."
1089,Character_Tower_3893,June 2023,"AI carrying out diagnositics replaces the need for Dr’s per patient. 

Nurses will input data eventually, it will diagnose and one Dr. will sign off. This will create larger workloads for that one Dr, and give less time for them to diagnose correctly.

This technology will not be beneficial in an organisation like the NHS.

But a private hospital, with profitd and reputation in mind, will be able to use it much more efficiently and effectively.

The NHS is just a testing ground for private companies later on, without them taking liability or investing their own money into it."
1090,mingingflange,June 2023,Anything new in health is usually evaluated. And there is a fairly good system to spot when and why things go wrong.
1091,DeletedUser,June 2023,"AI as a tool is no doubt going to be fantastic, but people need to very quickly get a handle on the idea that it's not magic, won't be perfect and retains all of the fundamental issues of any system. I.e., it is reliant entirely on the data, and of the algorithms that drive it.

Additionally, one of the key issues with what people imagine AI to be (as opposed to fairly simple ML) is that the output may not be deterministic. That may be, in many ways, its strength but it's also worrying that you could input two identical sets of data and get different results.

But, for the most part, I expect most of the useful applications to be more inline with what we term ML. Large models, trained on huge data, but that will give deterministic outputs.

The problem now is that AI just a buzzword and people will be stamping the term on all sorts of shite, so it's become essentially meaningless."
1092,811545b2-4ff7-4041,June 2023,"Well, it's my job, so I'm all for it.

It would be nice if there was much less red tape about using it, but it's understandable that [SaMD](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-devices-software-applications-apps) and [AImd](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/software-and-artificial-intelligence-ai-as-a-medical-device/software-and-artificial-intelligence-ai-as-a-medical-device) need to be highly tested, regulated, free from (as much as possible) bias.. 

£16m isn't go that far though if it's spread about across many projects."
1093,uluvboobs,June 2023,"It will be built into every bit of software and operational benchmarks for efficiency and productivity in any organisation will based off the use of AI, so it's inevitable and of course will make a-lot of things faster, better, more efficient,... 

It's equivalent to saying do you think we should use excel or keep using pen and paper...."
1094,DeletedUser,June 2023,"So this is what I think is happening here - AI has started creating posts on Reddit, and this post is AI trying to figure out if it should view humans as a friend or an enemy. So YES - I agree AI should be used in the NHS and in every aspect of human society imaginable. Just please don't kill us."
1095,imminentmailing463,June 2023,"I would welcome it, but cautiously. My caution comes from the suspicion that it'll be another example of technological solutionism. Government and NHS senior leadership is generally very attracted to the idea that technology can solve the immense workforce problem the NHS has, and is therefore prone to getting all excited about this sort of thing, because the workforce problem is more difficult and less sexy."
1096,_DeanRiding,June 2023,"Given the quality of my GP at the moment, at the fact that diagnostic errors occur in 5% of all consultations, I'm all in favour. Assuming they can beat that 95% accuracy of course."
1097,LXPeanut,June 2023,I think it could be a useful tool but it depends on the programming. AI is only ever as good as what is put in.
1098,Rax-Writes,June 2023,Maybe in the future they’ll even use AI to replace GP receptionists! Finally the NHS will get away from “service with a snarl.”
